This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

## Start the project

To get started right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

Happy testing!
